# Barracuda NextGen Firewall for Azure - High Availability Cluster using Internal Load Balancer and an Availability Set

## Introduction

Traditionally, Barracuda NextGen Firewall (NGF) uses UDR rewriting technique to redirect traffic when an HA failover happens. This method works well for smaller deployments, but has few drawbacks when using peered VNets or if corporate policy restricts saving AAD authentication keys in 3rd party software configuration.

Azure ILB solves above problems, providing failover capabilities with zero integration with the cloud fabric, offers shorter failover times (~15 seconds) independent of network complexity, and provides stateful failover.

This template deploys a VNet with 2 NGF instances with managed disks, an any-port ILB instance, and 2 empty subnets routed through NGF cluster.

## Prerequisites

The solution does a check of the template when you use the provided scripts. It does require that [Programmatic Deployment](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/working-with-marketplace-images-on-azure-resource-manager/) is enabled for the Barracuda Next Gen Firewall F BYOL or PAYG images. Barracuda recommends use of **D**, **D_v2**, **F** or newer series. 

This ARM template uses the Standard Load Balancer which is currently in preview. To enable this feature you need to run a couple of Powershell or Azure CLI 2.0 commands which can be found on the [Microsoft documentation page of this Standard Load Balancer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-standard-overview#preview-sign-up)

## Deployment

The package provides a deploy.ps1 and deploy.sh for Powershell or Azure CLI based deployments. This can be peformed from the Azure Portal as well as the any system that has either of these scripting infrastructures installed. Or you can deploy from the Azure Portal using the provided link.

## Deployed resources
Following resources will be created by the template:
- One Azure VNET with 3 subnets (1 for the NGF, additional subnets for a red and green subnet)
- Two route tables that will route all traffic for external and towards the other internal networks to the Barracuda NGF
- One internal standard Azure Load Balancer as the default gateway for all traffic that needs inspection
- One external standard Azure Load Balancer containing the deployed virtual machines with a public IP and services for IPSEC and TINA VPN tunnels available
- Two Barracuda NextGen Firewall F virtual machines with 1 network interface each and public IP
- Both NGF systems are deployed in an Availability Set

**Note** Additional backend subnets and resources are *not* automatically created by the template. This has to be done manually after template deployment has finished or by adapting the ARM template.

## Next Steps

After successful deployment you can manage them using NextGen Admin application available from Barracuda Download Portal. Management IP addresses you'll find in firewall instances properties, username is *root* and the password is what you provided during template deployment.

## Post Deployment Configuration

You need to create manually a firewall *App Redirect* rule for ILB Probe traffic. The connection will use the port you indicated during template deployment and it will originate from 168.63.129.16 and can be redirected to any service running locally on NGF (e.g. 127.0.0.1:450 for firewall authentication service or 127.0.0.1:691 for NGF TINA VPN)

It is also recommended you harden management access by enabling multifactor or key authentication and by restricting access to management interface using Management ACL: [How to Change the Root Password and Management ACL](https://campus.barracuda.com/product/nextgenfirewallf/article/NGF71/ChangeRootPWandMgmtACL/)
